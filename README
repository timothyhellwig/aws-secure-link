This simple WordPress plugin creates secure, temporary links to files on your private AWS server. It generates a unique link at "click time", and the link will expire shortly thereafter, based on your bucket settings.

To use it, simply drop the folder into your WP plugins folder, and edit the 'aws-credentials.php' file with your AWS connection settings, and the 'get-url.js' file with your site url.
Edit locations are clearly marked in both files, do not edit anything else.

Finally, simply create links in your posts using the shortcode: [aws_link file="INSERT-FILE-NAME-HERE"] where the file name is the exact name of the file residing in your AWS bucket.
